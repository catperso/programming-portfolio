      <h2><em>About Me</em></h2>
      <p>I was born and raised in Portland, OR. I've been using computers my entire life, helping my parents troubleshoot along the way as technology evolved and grew with me throughout my childhood, and I'm still who they call whenever something doesn't work right! I've always been interested in programming but it's only recently I decided to take my life more seriously and invest in a career around it, which is when I decided to enroll in Epicodus. I have a great sense of humour, and I'm happiest when surrounded by my friends as they're smiling and laughing. I'm surprised by how much I've already learned in my short time in this program, and I'm excited for all the new concepts and lessons to follow.</p>
      <h6>PS: My family name is Casperson, but I'm also known as Catperson, so don't be surprised by people calling me that.</h6>

      <h2><em>Other Hobbies and Interests</em></h2>
      <p>I enjoy playing <span class="important">Dungeons and Dragons</span>, as both a player and as the DM. Creating new worlds and inventive ways to torment my players are my favourite parts of the game. I also have been playing games on the computer for as long as I've had one, and I especially enjoy installing mods for my favourites. Dealing with the litany of errors that can come from modifying game files has helped me develop good troubleshooting skills that have already served me well in this program.</p>
